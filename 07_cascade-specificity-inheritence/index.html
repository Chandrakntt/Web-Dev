            <p class="start-para">The B-2 Spirit, more commonly known as the B-2 bomber, is one of the most advanced and iconic aircraft in the world. Developed by Northrop Grumman for the United States Air Force, the B-2 is a strategic stealth bomber capable of delivering both conventional and nuclear payloads. Since its first flight in 1989, the B-2 has remained a symbol of cutting-edge military technology and a cornerstone of America’s long-range strike capabilities.</p>
            <hr>
            <p class="para-1-h">Design and Stealth Capabilities</p>
            <p class="para-1">What sets the B-2 apart from other bombers is its stealthy design. Its sleek, flying wing shape lacks a traditional fuselage and tail, drastically reducing its radar cross-section. Made with radar-absorbent materials and equipped with sophisticated electronic countermeasures, the B-2 is extremely difficult to detect by enemy radar systems. This allows it to penetrate heavily defended airspace without being detected—an invaluable asset in modern warfare.</p>
            <p class="para-1">In addition to radar stealth, the B-2 is engineered to minimize its infrared, acoustic, and visual signatures. The engines are buried within the aircraft’s wing to reduce heat output, and the air intakes and exhausts are carefully shaped to suppress infrared emissions.</p>
            <hr>
            <p class="para-2-h">Performance and Armament</p>
            <p class="para-2">The B-2 is powered by four General Electric F118-GE-100 engines, allowing it to fly at subsonic speeds with an operational range of over 6,000 nautical miles without refueling. With aerial refueling, the B-2 can reach virtually any target in the world, making it a truly global strike platform.</p>
            <p class="para-2">Its internal bomb bays can carry up to 40,000 pounds (18,000 kg) of ordnance, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Nuclear bombs:</span> such as the B61 and B83 thermonuclear bombs.</li>
                <li><span>Conventional bombs:</span> including Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs), GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs), and other precision-guided munitions.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <p class="para-3-h">Operational History</p>
            <p class="para-3">Although it was originally developed during the Cold War as a nuclear deterrent, the B-2 has seen action in several conventional conflicts. Its first combat deployment was during the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Since then, it has been used in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria, often as the opening strike platform due to its ability to neutralize high-value targets with minimal risk of detection.</p>
            <p class="para-3">Despite its advanced capabilities, the B-2 is also one of the most expensive aircraft ever built. Each unit costs over $2 billion, factoring in research and development, with only 21 ever produced. Nevertheless, the aircraft’s strategic value continues to justify its high cost.</p>
            <hr>
            <p class="para-4-h">Modernization and Future</p>
            <p class="para-4">While the B-2 remains a formidable platform, it is scheduled to be gradually replaced by the upcoming B-21 Raider, which promises to build upon the B-2’s stealth and strike capabilities with improved survivability, digital systems, and operational flexibility.</p>
            <p class="para-4">However, until the B-21 enters full operational service, the B-2 remains one of the USAF's premier assets. It has been continuously upgraded with new avionics, communications, and weapons integration to keep it relevant in an evolving threat landscape.</p>
            <hr>
            <p class="para-5-h">Conclusion</p>
            <p class="para-5">The B-2 Spirit stands as a testament to American aerospace innovation and military strategy. With its unmatched stealth capabilities, global reach, and versatile payload, the B-2 continues to play a critical role in U.S. defense and power projection. Even decades after its debut, it remains one of the most advanced and feared aircraft in the skies—a true ghost of the battlefield.</p>
