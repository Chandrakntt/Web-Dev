It is the longest written constitution in the world, reflecting the diversity and complexity of the nation. Drafted by the Constituent Assembly under the leadership of <span>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar</span>, it establishes India as a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic. The Constitution guarantees fundamental rights to all citizens, promotes justice, liberty, and equality, and provides a federal structure with a strong central government.
