        <h1>BrahMos missile system</h1>
        <p>The <span class="bold">BrahMos missile system</span> is a supersonic cruise missile developed jointly by <span class="bold">India and Russia</span>, named after the Brahmaputra and Moskva rivers. Known for its <span class="bold">high speed (Mach 2.8 to 3.0)</span>, precision, and versatility, it can be launched from <span class="bold">land, sea, air, and even submarines</span>, making it a key part of India's strategic arsenal. The missile has a range of around <span class="bold">300 to 500 kilometers</span>, depending on the variant, and is capable of carrying conventional warheads. Its ability to fly at low altitudes and follow terrain-hugging trajectories makes it difficult to intercept, giving India a significant edge in modern warfare.

        <p class="features">key features of the BrahMos missile system:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="bold">Supersonic Speed:</span> Travels at speeds of Mach 2.8 to 3.0, making it one of the fastest cruise missiles in the world.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Multi-platform Launch Capability:</span> Can be launched from land-based mobile launchers, ships, submarines, and aircraft (like the Su-30MKI).</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Range:</span> Varies by variant — up to 500 km for newer versions (originally ~290 km to comply with MTCR limits before India’s entry into the regime).</li>
            <li><span class="bold">High Accuracy:</span> Precision strike capability with a circular error probable (CEP) of less than 1 meter.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Versatile Warhead Options</span>: Can carry conventional warheads weighing up to 200–300 kg.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Stealth Features:</span> Designed with low radar signature and terrain-hugging capability, making detection and interception difficult.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Fire-and-Forget System:</span> Does not require further guidance after launch.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Two-stage Propulsion:</span> Uses a solid-fuel booster for initial acceleration and a liquid-fuel ramjet for sustained supersonic cruise.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Quick Reaction Time:</span> Due to high speed and advanced guidance systems.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Indigenous Components:</span> Increasing localization in production, including efforts toward a BrahMos-NG (Next Generation) variant that will be lighter and more compact.</li>
